# ViewModelBinder

> A convenient **Flutter architecture** for happy programmers

## Getting Started

## Overview

### State Management

ViewModelBinder is based on streams. Streams are one of the core mechanics in Dart and in Flutter. Whether you are interacting with your database (e.g. Firebase) or trying to control the order and timing of requests sent to an API, streams are the most natural solution for these scenarios - we could say that streams are **idiomatic** in Flutter.

Why don't we use streams everywhere for simplicity and coherence then?! Streams are considered _difficult_, but that reputation is slightly exaggerated. Once you understand the benefits, there is no coming back to traditional state management approaches. And ViewModelBinder simplifies stream complexities - it's an easy to understand and coherent solution for state management in Flutter.

#### Reactive

Start by creating a `Manager`. It's a class that manages one or many data *stores*. It also exposes *actions* as methods to change the state in these data stores.

```dart
class CounterManager extends Manager {
  // 1. we create a data store (it's just a stream underneath)
  // Managers are immutable, thus stores must be `final`
  final counter = 0.reactive

  // 2. we define some actions
  void increment() => counter.value++;
  void decrement() => counter.value--;
  void add(int number) => counter.value += number;
}
```

Somewhere in the widget tree, inside the `build` method we can ask for a specific `Manager` by using the `use` method of the `BuildContext`

```dart
class Counter extends StatelessWidget { // Our widgets are *always* stateless
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // 3. we include a manager with `use`
    var manager = context.use<CounterManager>();

    return Center(
      // 4. we observe a part of widget tree
      child: Observer<int>(
        // 5. we listen to a specific stream from the manager
        stream: manager.counter,
        // 6. we rebuild once the stream changes
        builder: (context, value) => Text("Counter: $value"),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Reactivity is enabled for the following types in Dart:

##### `bool`

```dart
final value = false.reactive;
```

##### `int`

```dart
final value = 42.reactive;
```

##### `String`

```dart
final value = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'.reactive;
```

##### `List`

```dart
final value = <String>[].reactive
```

#### Automatic Provider Setup

Use the `ViewModelBinder` widget to split the responsibilities and reduce the boilerplate so that you can write this:

```dart
final supervisor = Supervisor()
  .register<AManager>(() => AManager())

void main() => runApp(ViewModelBinder(supervisor: supervisor, child: App()));

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      ...
    )
  }
}
```

instead of this:

```dart
void main() => runApp(EmailApp());

class EmailApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Provider(
      data: Supervisor()
          .register<AManager>(() => AManager())
      child: MaterialApp(
        ...
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

#### Manager asks another Manager for help

In this example `LoginManager` asks for `AuthManager`. This goes through `Supervisor` and the requested manager is either provided as-is or instantiated.

```dart
class LoginManager extends Manager {
   void logout() {
     var manager = use<AuthManager>()

     manager.setAuthState(AuthState.loggedOut);
   }

   @override
   void dispose() {}
 }
```

### Convenience Methods

Some convenience methods that follow the Pareto principle, i.e. ViewModelBinder makes aliases for the most common code scenarios.

#### Navigation

To change routes, you can write

```dart
context.display(AnotherPage())
```

instead of

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => AnotherPage()),
);
```

#### SnackBar

To display a snackbar, you can write:

```dart
context.showSnackBar("...you text");
```

instead of

```dart
Scaffold.of(context).showSnackBar(
  SnackBar(content: Text('Yay! A SnackBar!'))
);
```

### mediaQuerySize

to get MediaQuery Size, you can write:

```dart
context.mediaQuerySize
```

instead of

```dart

MediaQuery.of(context).size

```

### orientation

to get Device orientation, you can write:

```dart
context.orientation
```

instead of

```dart

MediaQuery.of(context).orientation

```

### isLandscape

to check if Device orientation is Landscape, you can write:

```dart
context.isLandscape
```

instead of

```dart

MediaQuery.of(context).orientation == Orientation.landscape

```

### isPortrait

to check if Device orientation is Portrait, you can write:

```dart
context.isPortrait
```

instead of

```dart

MediaQuery.of(context).orientation == Orientation.portrait

```

#### Padding

Use `.padding()` method on widgets directly

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Text("User 1").padding(8),
    Text("User 2").padding(8),
  ],
);
```

instead of wrapping them with `Padding`:

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Text("User 1"),
    ),
    Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Text("User 2"),
    ),
  ],
);
```

#### Center

Use `.center()` method on widgets directly

```dart
Column(
  children: [

  ],
).center();
```

instead of wrapping them with `Center`:

```dart
Center(
  child:Column(
    children: [

    ],
)
);
```
